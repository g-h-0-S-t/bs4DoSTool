# bs4DoSTool
A GET attack using the Beautiful Soup (bs4) package in Python 3.

**Usage Example:** 
```python
python bs4DoSTool.py https://google.com
```
**Tips:**

(1) Use it with VPN / WHONIX for 'anonymity'.

(2) Run it in multiple terminals. ;) 

(3) A cute DDoS tip -> Randomize UA.

E.g., UA+=UA for 10000000 times, then concat it with 'counter' and pass it to UA.
You'll have dynamic UAs with huge data.
Might overwhelm a small server after few hits.
Throw in a VPN with dynamic location switch.
